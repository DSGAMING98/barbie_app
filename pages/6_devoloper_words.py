Hey there 👋,

First off — **thank you** for checking out this app!  
This whole project has been a mix of curiosity, caffeine, and *way too many late nights*.  
I’m still learning coding step-by-step, so if you find anything that's broken, weird, or just plain cursed… well, that’s part of the journey. 😅

I’ve built this using **Streamlit**, **Python**, and **a lot of trial and error**.  
Right now, this app has only the features you see — but depending on how well **Streamlit behaves** and **GitHub cooperates**, there *might* be updates in the future.  
*(No promises though — consider it a “maybe” rather than a guarantee.)*

---

### Why I made this  
I wanted to create something fun, interactive, and a little different from your average app.  
Every page, every feature, and every quirk you see is the result of me trying, failing, fixing, and eventually getting it to work.

---

### If you enjoyed this  
- Drop a ⭐ on the GitHub repo — it means more than you think!  
- Share it with your friends — maybe they’ll love it more.  
- Or just keep playing around and see what you can make.

---

For now, this is where the app stands.  
Whether you’re here for fun, nostalgia, or curiosity, I’m glad you stopped by.

**Developed by Prajwal**  
*(With plenty of love, learning, and a little bit of chaos.)*
